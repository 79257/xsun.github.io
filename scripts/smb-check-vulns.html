<h2> User Summary </h2>

<p>
Checks for vulnerabilities:
<ul>
<li>MS08-067, a Windows RPC vulnerability
</li>
<li>Conficker, an infection by the Conficker worm
</li>
<li>Unnamed regsvc DoS, a denial-of-service vulnerability I accidentally found in Windows 2000
</li>
<li>SMBv2 exploit (CVE-2009-3103, Microsoft Security Advisory 975497)
</li>
<li>MS06-025, a Windows Ras RPC service vulnerability
</li>
<li>MS07-029, a Windows Dns Server RPC service vulnerability
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
WARNING: These checks are dangerous, and are very likely to bring down a server. 
These should not be run in a production environment unless you (and, more importantly,
the business) understand the risks! 
</p>
<p>
As a system administrator, performing these kinds of checks is crucial, because 
a lot more damage can be done by a worm or a hacker using this vulnerability than
by a scanner. Penetration testers, on the other hand, might not want to use this
script -- crashing services is not generally a good way of sneaking through a 
network. 
</p>
<p>
If you set the script parameter <code>unsafe</code>, then scripts will run that are almost 
(or totally) guaranteed to crash a vulnerable system; do NOT specify <code>unsafe</code>
in a production environment! And that isn't to say that non-unsafe scripts will 
not crash a system, they're just less likely to. 
</p>
<p>
If you set the script parameter <code>safe</code>, then script will run that rarely or never
crash a vulnerable system. No promises, though. 
</p>
<p>
MS08-067. Checks if a host is vulnerable to MS08-067, a Windows RPC vulnerability that
can allow remote code execution.  Checking for MS08-067 is very dangerous, as the check 
is likely to crash systems. On a fairly wide scan conducted by Brandon Enright, we determined
that on average, a vulnerable system is more likely to crash than to survive
the check. Out of 82 vulnerable systems, 52 crashed. 
At the same time, MS08-067 is extremely critical to fix. Metasploit has a working and
stable exploit for it, and any system vulnerable can very easily be compromised. 
Conficker. Checks if a host is infected with a known Conficker strain. This check
is based on the simple conficker scanner found on this page:
<a href="http://iv.cs.uni-bonn.de/wg/cs/applications/containing-conficker">http://iv.cs.uni-bonn.de/wg/cs/applications/containing-conficker</a>.
Thanks to the folks who wrote that scanner!
</p>
<p>
regsvc DoS. Checks if a host is vulnerable to a crash in regsvc, caused 
by a null pointer dereference. I inadvertently discovered this crash while working
on <code>smb-enum-sessions</code>, and discovered that it was repeatable. It's been 
reported to Microsoft (case #MSRC8742). 
</p>
<p>
This check WILL crash the service, if it's vulnerable, and requires a guest account
or higher to work. It is considered <code>unsafe</code>. 
</p>
<p>
SMBv2 DoS. Performs a denial-of-service against the vulnerability disclosed in
CVE-2009-3103. Checks if the server went offline. This works agianst Windows Vista
and some versions of Windows 7, and causes a bluescreen if successful. The
proof-of-concept code at <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Sep/39">http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Sep/39</a> was used, 
with one small change. 
</p>
<p>
MS06-025. Vulnerability targets the <code>RasRpcSumbitRequest()</code> RPC method which is
a part of RASRPC interface that serves as a RPC service for configuring and 
getting information from the Remote Access and Routing service. RASRPC can be
accessed using either "\ROUTER" SMB pipe or the "\SRVSVC" SMB pipe (usually on Windows XP machines).
This is in RPC world known as "ncan_np" RPC transport. <code>RasRpcSumbitRequest()</code>
method is a generic method which provides different functionalities according
to the <code>RequestBuffer</code> structure and particulary the <code>RegType</code> field within that 
structure. <code>RegType</code> field is of <code>enum ReqTypes</code> type. This enum type lists all
the different available operation that can be performed using the <code>RasRpcSubmitRequest()</code>
RPC method. The one particular operation that this vuln targets is the <code>REQTYPE_GETDEVCONFIG</code> 
request to get device information on the RRAS.
</p>
<p>
MS07-029. Vulnerability targets the <code>R_DnssrvQuery()</code> and <code>R_DnssrvQuery2()</code> RPC method which is
a part of DNS Server RPC interface that serves as a RPC service for configuring and 
getting information from the DNS Server service. DNS Server RPC service can be
accessed using "\dnsserver" SMB named pipe. The vulnerability is triggered when
a long string is send as the "zone" parameter which causes the buffer overflow which
crashes the service.
</p>
<p>
(Note: if you have other SMB/MSRPC vulnerability checks you'd like to see added, and
you can show me a tool with a license that is compatible with Nmap's, post a request 
on the nmap-dev mailing list and I'll add it to my list [Ron Bowes].)</p>







  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
  
  
    
    
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
      
        
      
    
  
  
    
    
  

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  



  <h2> Script Arguments </h2>
  <p>
    
      <h4> safe </h4>
      <p>
If set, this script will only run checks that are known (or at
      least suspected) to be safe.</p>

    
      <h4> unsafe </h4>
      <p>
If set, this script will run checks that, if the system isn't
      patched, are basically guaranteed to crash something. Remember that
      non-unsafe checks aren't necessarily safe either)</p>
